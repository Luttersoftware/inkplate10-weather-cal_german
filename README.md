Best paired with the Calendar server: [eink-cal-server](https://github.com/chrisjtwomey/eink-cal-server)

Refreshes the display with an image generated by the Calendar server at a set time each day, client will then deep sleep until the next refresh.

This is designed to work with the [Inkplate10](https://www.crowdsupply.com/soldered/inkplate-10). For a more generic eink display or DIY build, there is a [branch](https://github.com/chrisjtwomey/eink-cal-client/tree/gxepd2) that's designed to work with GXEPD2.
